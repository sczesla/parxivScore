What is it?
-----------

    parxivScore is a small "app" to download the astro-ph RSS feed
    and rate the thus obtained articles with respect to relevance.
    The output is written to an HTML-formatted file.

Installation and usage
----------------------

    parxivScore is a standalone script, i.e., download and put in
    a place of your liking. In the simplest case use:

        python parxivScore.py

    Use the --help flag to see available parameters.

Customizing scoring
-------------------

    The rating details are specified in a configuration file, of which a stub
    is provided in the form of the 'parxiv.config' file. In particular, you are
    free to define individual buzzwords to be searched for in the title and
    abstract of the article, author surnames and -- optionally -- initials, and
    the astro-ph subcategory. In general, buzzwords are given as regular
    expressions. For each scoring rule such as a buzzword, you must provide a
    relevance in form of an integer number, which measure the importance, which
    you assign to the individual rule.

    TIP: When the HTML-output is displayed by a browser, the rating details are
         shown when hovering over the score value.

Requirements
------------

    Beyond standard-library modules, parxivScore relies on numpy and feedparser.
